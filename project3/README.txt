---------------------------------------------------
Gameplay:
Fend off waves of zombies inside of your city,
then face down your partner as only one can
survive the invasion.
Use weapons and powerups to your advantage as
you navigate the streets and corridors to survive.

--------------------------------------------------
Intended Feeling:
The game is intended to have a fairly quick play 
cycle (around 3-5 minutes per round). Thus,
there should be a sense of tension during gameplay
with an overall jovial competitiveness that comes
from player-vs-player games.
